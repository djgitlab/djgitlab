# Hi, I’m David 👋

I build **production-grade SharePoint Online and Power Platform solutions** that automate real business workflows and hold up under governance, scale, and change.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of business operations and Microsoft 365. I design solutions that line of business, program managers, and technology & operations teams actually rely on day to day, not just demos that look good in screenshots.

## What I Focus On

- Power Apps and Power Automate solutions used in live environments
- SharePoint Online list architecture, security, and performance
- Microsoft Graph API integrations, especially Outlook and calendar workflows
- Clean solution structure, ALM, and long-term maintainability
- Defensive design with logging, retries, and clear failure handling

I care a lot about clarity. Code should be understandable by the next person who inherits it, not just the person who wrote it.
